# DD2360
Applied GPU Programming

In order to check the outputs create a `data` directory:

```bash
cd DD2360-PIC
mkdir data
```

## Compilation

In order to compile the code:

```bash
make
```

## Running the Code

In order to run the code, use the following command:

```bash
./bin/sputnicPIC.out <input_file>
```

The input files can be found inside the `inputfiles` directory.
For example:

```bash
./bin/sputnicPIC.out inputfiles/GEM_2D.inp
```

## Checking Outputs

After running the code, the output will be stored in the `data` directory.
It can be opened with the `Paraview` application or with a text editor.
